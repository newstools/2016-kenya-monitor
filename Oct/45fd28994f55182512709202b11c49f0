Victor Yegon, an activist wants the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Director of Criminal Investigations compelled to lodge a hate speech case against photojournalist and activist Boniface Mwangi for his social media posts. Mr. Yegon accuses Boniface of inciting Kenyans through his social media pages. He says the contents of the messages are likely to fan violence and breach peace in the country hence he should be stopped from further publishing inciting comments on his social media pages. He argues it is against the National Cohesion and Integration Act (NCIC Act) hence Boniface should be stopped. Through lawyer, Ham Langat, Mr. Yegon claims that Mwangi has been using his social media platform to fan ethnic violence and incite the public contrary. He adds that unless the court issues orders, there will be continuous degeneration as well as constitutional breach of peace. The activist further claimed that if the situation is not arrested by the courts, Mr. Mwangi will continue to polarize the country and create ethnic animosity, which if left unchecked, will destroy peace within the country. Mr. Yegon further takes issue with the pouring of a red substance to police Spokesman Charles Owino during the Willy Kimani protests terming the act undermining the authority of a public officer which is a crime in the Penal Code. “Mwangi’s conduct should not go unpunished. His actions are enough evidence that the offence of hate speech and public peace has arisen and should not be left without legal consequence,” said Yegon.
